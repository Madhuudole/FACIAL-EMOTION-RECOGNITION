# Facial Emotion Recognition  

This repository contains a **Facial Emotion Recognition** project that uses deep learning techniques to classify facial emotions from images or video frames. The model leverages advanced neural networks to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.  

---

## 📋 **Features**  
- Real-time emotion detection from webcam or pre-recorded videos.  
- Supports a variety of facial expressions using pre-trained models.  
- Implements transfer learning with CNN architectures for high accuracy.  
- Interactive visualizations of detected emotions.
